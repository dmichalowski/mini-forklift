# Mini-forklift project
Idea was to create platform having similar capabilities to full-sized forklift.

Project contained the making of physical structure as well as programming and electronics.

## Construction
In the lower front part of the vehicle DC motors which, are located responsible for vehicle movement, while in the rear part a rotary wheel is placed. Such kinematics enable, with a large wheelbase, dynamic rotation almost in place.

Lifting mechanism was created using drylin linear guide with bar screw ([igus](https://www.igus.eu/drylin/linear-guide)).

Most of the structure was made using wood. But all assembly components and forks were made usind 3-d printing technology.

## Electronics
All project consinst of:
* 2 x L298 Drive Module
* Arduino Uno
* HC-06 bluetooth module
* Battery

## Control



## Prologue
Project was done in order to finish recruitment to "Synergia" science club in PWR.
